 My name is  Gowtham, and I bring over 17 years of IT experience across various roles including production
 support, data migration, business analysis, and team management. In my previous positions, I have worked in
 agile environments where I was involved in agile ceremonies and actively supported the adoption of Scrum
 practices. For instance, I have facilitated daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives, ensuring that
 the team remained aligned with the project goals. My experience also includes collaborating with business
 stakeholders and technical teams to ensure that requirements are clearly understood and efficiently
 delivered. I believe my background in both technical execution and agile project leadership equips me to drive
 continuous improvement and foster collaboration within the team at UST.
 
 2.l Answer:
 In this scenario, I would take a structured approach. First, I would hold one-on-one sessions with team
 members to understand any individual challenges and gain insights into what specific technical hurdles are
 occurring. This would be followed by a team meeting to discuss common issues and realign our sprint
 commitments. Next, I would work with the team to break down large user stories into smaller, manageable
 subtasks so that issues and potential risks become evident earlier in the sprint, leading to more accurate
 estimates. I’d also encourage technical spikes where necessary to mitigate high-risk uncertainties early on.
 Additionally, I would ensure that risk assessments are improved and that all tasks are clearly documented, so
 the team and stakeholders are aligned. Lastly, I would incorporate regular retrospective sessions to discuss
 what can be improved in both our planning and execution, and I would foster a culture of continuous learning
 to address recurring technical challenges.

3.I managed incident resolution through diligent use of service management tools like Jira
and ServiceNow. My approach begins with early detection and accurate logging of incidents to ensure all
relevant data such as timestamps, impacted systems, and service levels are captured. I then prioritize and
categorize incidents based on their urgency and impact on operations. Throughout the incident lifecycle, I
ensure clear communication and coordination among the support team, vendors, and other stakeholders to
work towards a swift resolution. After the incident is resolved, I document the resolution steps and conduct a
thorough root cause analysis, which includes updating knowledge base articles and implementing corrective
actions to prevent recurrence. This structured methodology not only minimizes downtime but also
contributes directly to operational excellence by improving our SLA adherence and overall service reliability.
For example, in a previous project, this process enabled my team to reduce

4,In data migrations and process updates, I ensure data integrity and optimize system performance by starting
with comprehensive data profiling and validations. I first profile the source data using built-in functions in our
ETL tool to understand its structure, quality, and any potential anomalies. Based on that, I establish data
validation rules and checks that align with business requirements. This involves creating detailed
source-to-target mapping documents and reconciliation queries to compare data counts and values at every
stage of the migration. I also incorporate incremental loading strategies to reduce processing times and
minimize system load, rather than relying solely on full loads. Additionally, I monitor the migration process in
real-time and conduct periodic performance tuning by optimizing our mapping designs and adjusting
resource allocations. This approach not only helps maintain data accuracy but also ensures that the system
consistently meets performance benchmark targets while quickly addressing any discrepancies or
performance bottlenecks.

5.In the situation of customer escalations due to recurring system issues, I would first ensure a thorough
understanding of the issue by gathering all the relevant details, including previous troubleshooting steps,
impact on customers, and historical data related to the incident. I would communicate promptly with the
customer by acknowledging the issue, apologizing for the inconvenience, and providing an estimated timeline
for resolution. Simultaneously, I would coordinate with the technical team—using tools like ServiceNow or
JIRA—to set up clear escalations, track incident progress, and ensure the right expertise is involved. I would
document every step of the process for further analysis, carry out a root cause analysis once the issue is
resolved, and then develop preventive measures to avoid future recurrences. Finally, I would follow up with
the customer to confirm that the solution is working as expected and ensure continuous monitoring to
prevent similar issues, all while keeping all stakeholders updated through regular status reports.

 6.During the migration from Teradata to Azure Synapse, we faced several key challenges. First, there were
issues with incompatible datatypes and differences in SQL functions; certain Teradata-specific functions did
not have direct equivalents in Synapse. To address this, we performed a thorough code review and rewrote
the SQL scripts, replacing unsupported functions with appropriate Synapse alternatives, sometimes using
workarounds like intermediate staging tables to bridge the gap. Secondly, performance and optimization were
critical. We tackled this by creating temporary or intermediate tables to load data for ATL processes and
performing extensive performance tuning, including query optimization and resource configuration
adjustments. Additionally, data integrity was a major concern; we implemented robust validation
processes—using checksums, data type comparisons, and dropouts where necessary—to ensure that no data
was lost or corrupted during the migration. Overall, close collaboration with the QA team and continuous
monitoring during the migration helped mitigate risks and ensured a smooth transition from Teradata to
Synapse.
7.A solid approach would be: 'Upon discovering data discrepancies post-migration, my first step would be to
immediately restrict user access to prevent further data manipulation while I perform a thorough initial
assessment. I would review logs and migration reports to identify specific failed transactions or missing data
segments and compare source and target datasets using established SQL queries or checksum validations.
Next, I would identify if the discrepancies are due to mapping errors, transformation logic mistakes, or data
format issues. In the test environment, I would apply corrective measures, simulate the corrections, and
ensure that the fixes restore data integrity. After validating the solution, I would update our migration process
by strengthening data quality checkpoints, automating error logging, and implementing continuous
monitoring to flag similar issues earlier. Finally, I would document the root cause, the actions taken, lessons
learned, and ensure open communication with stakeholders to prevent future occurrences.' This answer
outlines a clear, structured approach and emphasizes prevention measures, which aligns well with both the
job requirements and my experience with projects involving ETL, data validations, and post-migration
support.
8.In a complex data migration project with multiple cross-functional teams, I would start by organizing a kickoff
meeting to clearly define roles, responsibilities, and expectations for each team member. I would develop a
detailed migration plan with timelines, key milestones, and potential risk areas, ensuring that each task is
assigned and that everyone understands their part. I would establish a centralized communication platform
for daily updates, status meetings, and quick resolution of issues. In addition, I’d implement structured
check-ins and progress reviews, where unexpected challenges are immediately escalated using pre-defined
risk mitigation and escalation paths. Continuous feedback loops through stand-up meetings, surveys, or
direct communication with stakeholders would allow us to adapt the plan in real-time, ensuring that the
project stays on track and that data integrity is maintained throughout the migration process.

9.In managing a large-scale ETL migration project, if I encounter unexpected data inconsistencies,
 I would first conduct an immediate impact assessment to understand the breadth and depth of the issue.
 I would isolate the problem by reproducing it in a lower environment, which helps in determining the root cause.
 Based on the findings, I would develop and implement a data cleansing strategy and reprocess the affected data. 
 Throughout this process, I would maintain clear communication with stakeholders, keeping them informed about the issue and planned actions. 
 Once the fix is validated in the lower environment through thorough testing and UAT, I would then deploy the solution in the production environment.
 Additionally, I would document the findings and lessons learned to prevent future issues and improve the overall ETL process. This structured 
 approach not only ensures timely delivery but also minimizes the risk of similar issues in the future.

10.In a scenario where a critical project is delayed due to unforeseen technical challenges and increasing stakeholder pressure, I would begin by
 reassessing the project status in collaboration with team leads. First, I would schedule an immediate team meeting to identify the root causes of 
 the delay, re-evaluate the current timelines, and re-prioritize tasks based on critical path activities. I would facilitate a session to develop an 
 updated, realistic project plan, outlining clear short-term milestones and contingency measures. Concurrently, I would communicate transparently
 with stakeholders by acknowledging the challenges, presenting the revised plan, and setting clear expectations regarding new timelines and 
 deliverables. I would set up regular status updates and feedback loops to ensure continuous alignment with both the team and stakeholders. 
 Finally, I would identify any process improvements or technical adjustments needed, for instance, leveraging reusable components only if they
 support the project timelines, ensuring that these adjustments do not detract from the main focus of clear communication and coordinated realignment.
